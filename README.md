- Dockerize that(The code will be explain what it do and dockerized your )
  <img width="1918" height="994" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bb73432-6e15-4047-b974-a3c90365eb24" />
   # **Specila Resources**
      - Find the image tipe : https://hub.docker.com/_/python

    ****(Now we have a Docker file then we have to build the Docker Image.)****

- Open the VS code Terminal,

- Type the **"docker build -t my-first-app ."** in VS code and run that command
 
  (This command not run you are not open the local Docker.Firstly you open the Docker and Sign your account)
  <img width="606" height="97" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20003f0b-10e1-47cc-a219-cd7a85df94ab" />
  output,

  (wait a few secound for that ,all the dependencies are install the docker Image.)
    -After few secound,you can see your Docker image in your local Dockerhub.
     <img width="1913" height="1011" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7b667cb-2003-4ee5-bc71-56762437a752" />

  # now We are create a Docker Image then now we have to build the Docker Container,

  - Type the **"docker images"** in VS Code and run the Command
    <img width="639" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b3d14a2-b4b5-4e82-a563-a24a6e2d2dd4" />

  - Type the **"docker run -p 5000:5000 **{image ID}** "** in VS Code and run the command,
    (image ID mean This is the id of the docker image you created, you can get it from the step above.My image ID = c628931fbee7  )
        <img width="1290" height="337" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67af5257-31c7-4abc-8955-aa99a8e47d6e" />

 (Is that work,Then it meaning is your are correctly build a Docker Container)


### **6. Create ECR using Python Boto3**

(This is the Boto3 documantation in ECR = https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ecr.html )

- Create a new file in vs code, and name that **"ecr.py"**
  <img width="1154" height="691" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-28 093046" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/118d2210-fb3d-4b8b-8c8a-793b4fa9464c" />

- **Copy the code into ecr.py**
      <img width="1919" height="987" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/044a67c5-9e1b-4b3c-aecd-8b008577bdb0" />
    (This mean we make the AWS ECR new repo using above code)
    (Save that code !)
- After that open the VS Code Terminal and run that command (python ecr.py),
  (Is that not work! firstly, you Create a fresh virtual environment and after run that)
  <img width="520" height="49" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a2b0004-3437-46da-84ce-91c64f2f9ef1" />

  ## ***(Now we cheack aboue code is work)***

- Run the command in  **"kubectl get pods -n default -w "**
  (This command is extremely useful when youâ€™re deploying apps or debugging pods and want to see real-time changes without running the command repeatedly)
  <img width="676" height="108" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6d59140-9470-43d6-b007-8958120c0418" />
    (Stop that! **CTRL+C**)
- Run the command in  **" kubectl get deployment -n default "**

  (This command is extremely useful when youâ€™re deploying applications or managing deployments and want to quickly check the status of your deployments (number of pods ready, updated, and available) in the default namespace, without digging into individual pods.)
  
  <img width="605" height="65" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed135396-567b-47bf-bb7e-2e3771d71f85" />
  
- Run the command in  **" kubectl get svc -n default "**
  (This command is extremely useful when you want to check the status of services in your cluster, including their IP addresses, ports, and type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), in the default namespace. It helps you verify connectivity and expose your applications without inspecting each pod individually.)
  
  <img width="786" height="117" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47535a7d-6c7e-4d60-9cc7-25677608daeb" />
### 11. Port Forward Kubernetes Service and Access the Application.
-Run that command **"kubectl port-forward svc/my-flask-service 5000:5000"**

-Open the web brower and copy the url,and search.
